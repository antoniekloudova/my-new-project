# AI Book Recommender

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

This project aims to develop an AI-powered system that provides personalized book recommendations to users based on their reading preferences. By analyzing user's reading history and genre interests, the system will provide relevant book recomendations, fostering a love for reading and making book discovery easier.


## Background

While book recommendations are common, personalized suggestions that align precisely with an individual's taste can be rare. This project seeks to tackle this problem by using AI to understand users' preferences and offer tailored suggestions.


## How is it used?

Users will interact with the system through a user-friendly interface, providing information about their favorite genres, past reading choices, and specific interests. Leaving AI, the system analyzes this data to generate personalized book recomendations. The solution can be utilized by anyone who enjoys reading and wants to discover new books that align with their preferences.


## Data sources and AI methods

The data are collected from various sources, including user interactions, book databases, or online platforms, depending on the implementation and scope of the project.


## Challenges

The project does not tackle book accessibility or copyright challenges. It emphasizes the importance of addresing ethical considerations to safeguard user privacy and data protection while providing relevant recommendations.


## What next?

The project has potential for expandion by integrating natural language processing to understand user reviews and further improve the recommendations. To advance further, access to a comprehensive database of books and reader reviews, would be beneficial.
