# AI Book Recommender

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

This project aims to develop an AI-powered system that provides personalized book recommendations to users based on their reading preferences. By analyzing user's reading history and genre preferences, the system will suggest relevant books, fostering a love for reading and making book discovery easier.


## Background

The problem this idea solves is the overwhelming task of finding the right books to read in a vast sea of options. Book recommendations are common, but personalized ones that truly match an individual's taste can be rare. This project seeks to address this problem by using AI to understand users' preferences and offer tailored suggestions.


## How is it used?

Users will interact with the system through a user-friendly interface, providing information about their favorite genres, past reads, and any specific interests. The AI system will then analyze this data and provide book recommendations accordingly. The solution can be utilized by anyone who enjoys reading and wants to discover new books that align with their preferences.

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

prepsat:The project does not address issues related to book accessibility or copyright challenges. Additionally, ethical considerations must be taken into account to ensure user privacy and data protection while providing relevant recommendations.


## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on? 

prepsat: The project could expand by integrating natural language processing to understand user reviews and further improve the recommendations. To advance this project, additional resources, such as access to a vast database of books and reader reviews, would be beneficial.
